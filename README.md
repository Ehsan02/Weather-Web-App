# Weather Web-App using Vanilla JS

This is  a Weather Web-App using Vanilla JavaScript

In this app, I have fetched the data from openweathermap.org  for current weather report and according to the weather the background will change.
You have to use your API to see the weather report.


Hope you'll like this!
